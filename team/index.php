				I know it’s a bit of a cliché to say it's people who give a company its strength, however, this is a cliché I truly embrace and believe in. I can’t tell you how much I value and am impressed with our stellar team of writers. They hail from all parts of the globe, are multi-lingual, and have excelled in more than several business domains. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading their biographies as much as I continue to value their intelligence, work ethic, humanity, and character.<br />
