                        <p class="text-white">Dear Ms. Smith:</p>
                        <p class="text-white">I know how much the performing and cultural arts means to you. Your commitment, hard work, and
                            sacrifice ensure that the arts will continue to enrich the lives of children of all ages and adults too. In
                            light of this affection and commitment, please consider our request for financial support to provide 20
                            Irvington young people, ages 15 through 18, the opportunity to experience the magic of the Alvin
                            Ailey American Dance Theater on December 9, 2006 at New York City Center.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">An Afternoon with Alvin Ailey is the first collaboration between two community service organizations:
                            Art 4 Kidz and Alliance Arts &amp; Community. As you might expect, the primary purpose of our program
                            is to introduce the performing arts to a group of urban youngsters who might not otherwise have the
                            opportunity. In fact, our An Afternoon with Alvin Ailey is the first of what
                            we hope will be many cultural excursions to performing arts and cultural
                            events throughout the tri-state area for Irvington youth of all ages. I am
                            sure you can appreciate the excitement of attending a New York City
                            theater performance and having dinner afterwards—especially during
                            the holiday season. The cool night air coupled with brightly lit store
                            windows are like icing on a cake after a memorable theater
                            performance. In fact, I can remember going to see Alvin Ailey, Dance
                            Theater of Harlem and Broadway performances such as Amadeus and The Phantom of the Opera as
                            a youth with my family. Attending those performances years ago instilled in me an appreciation for
                            the arts that remains today and I would like to pass on my appreciation to the children in my
                            community.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">In my family there were no cultural or economic barriers impeding my access to the arts; in fact my
                            family encouraged it. However, many Irvington children come from single parent and no parent
                            households that are both economically and culturally disadvantaged. Their caregivers, due to
                            financial or other restrictions, cannot provide these children access to the arts—or worse their
                            caregivers have little knowledge or appreciation for the arts themselves. Also, public school funding
                            for the arts and arts education have all but evaporated. Consequently, opportunities for these
                            children to embrace the arts on any level have all but disappeared. And adding insult to injury is the
                            fact that New York City theater ticket prices have probably doubled over the last 10 years. Sadly, “a
                            night out at the theater” is almost completely out of reach for most young people from my community
                            and their families.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Our proposed An Afternoon with Alvin Ailey would, at least for one night, allow these youngsters to
                            hurtle the social and economic barriers to the arts and deliver them from an environment that for
                            some is filled with danger and hopelessness. On December 9 th , they will be thrust into a world of
                            vibrant colors, agile movements, music, and boundless energy and creativity of modern dance.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">The experience of seeing Alvin Ailey’s remarkable dancers performing at such a high skill level will in
                            turn build their self confidence to excel at any endeavor of their choosing including the performing
                            arts. Seeing Alvin Ailey no doubt will be an experience these youngsters will remember for a lifetime
                            and plant in them an appreciation for the arts that they can pass along to their siblings, friends, others
                            in the community and, one day, their children. I feel honored to be part of this experience. Perhaps
                            you will too!</p>
